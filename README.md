# Simple Linear Regression Model for Predicting Salary Based on Years of Experience
Overview
This repository contains a simple linear regression model built to predict the salary of an individual based on their years of experience. The dataset used includes 30 observations with two features: YearsExperience and Salary.

Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

YearsExperience: The number of years of professional experience.
Salary: The annual salary in dollars.
Model
The simple linear regression model was built using the scikit-learn library. The model aims to find the best-fitting line that predicts the Salary based on the YearsExperience.
